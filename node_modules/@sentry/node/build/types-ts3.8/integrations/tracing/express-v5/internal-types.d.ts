 *
 * It is necessary because express doesn't store the different layers
 * (ie: middleware, router etc) that it called to get to the current layer.
 * Given that, the only way to know the route of a given layer is to
 * store the path of where each previous layer has been mounted.
 *
 * ex: bodyParser > auth middleware > /users router > get /:id
 *  in this case the stack would be: ["/users", "/:id"]
 *
 * ex2: bodyParser > /api router > /v1 router > /users router > get /:id
 *  stack: ["/api", "/v1", "/users", ":id"]
