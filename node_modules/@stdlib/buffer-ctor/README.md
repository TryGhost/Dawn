    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var Buffer = require( '@stdlib/buffer-ctor' );
```

#### Buffer( size )

Allocates a [`Buffer`][node-buffer] having a specified number of bytes.

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/require-globals, no-buffer-constructor -->

```javascript
var b = new Buffer( 10 );
// returns <Buffer>
```

#### Buffer( array )

Allocates a [`Buffer`][node-buffer] from an array of octets.

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/require-globals, no-buffer-constructor -->

```javascript
var b = new Buffer( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] );
// returns <Buffer>[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

#### Buffer( buffer )

Copies [buffer][node-buffer] data to a new [`Buffer`][node-buffer] instance.

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/require-globals, no-buffer-constructor -->

```javascript
var b1 = new Buffer( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] );
var b2 = new Buffer( b1 );
// returns <Buffer>[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

#### Buffer( str\[, encoding] )

Returns a [`Buffer`][node-buffer] containing a provided `string`.

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/require-globals, no-buffer-constructor -->

```javascript
var b = new Buffer( 'beep boop' );
// returns <Buffer>
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var ctor = require( '@stdlib/buffer-ctor' );

var b;
var i;

// Allocate uninitialized memory:
if ( typeof ctor.alloc === 'function' ) {
    b = ctor.alloc( 10 );
} else {
    b = new ctor( 10 );
}

// Zero fill the buffer...
for ( i = 0; i < b.length; i++ ) {
    b[ i ] = 0;
}
console.log( b );
